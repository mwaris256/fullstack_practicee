        <h1>Welcome to My World</h1>
        <p>Hi, My name is <b>Muzammil Waris</b></p>

        <p>I was born on February 25th, 1993 in Karachisiiiiiiiiiiii Pakistan. Me and my family then moved 
        to Canada when I was five years old. I just have one sister. I love to play and 
        watch cricket and soccer.I also like watching movies and tv shows. 
        </p>

        <p>These are the sport teams thatss I support:</p>
        Pakistan Cricket Team <br>
        Karachi Kings<br>
        Chelsea FC <br>
        Germany's national football team</p>
        
        <p style="color: blue;font-size: larger;">My favorite color is blue. Blue is also the 
            color of Chelsea FC's home kit. My favorite players from Chelsea are Didier Drogba, 
            Frank Lampard, Eden Hazard and Cole Palmer.

        <p>My favourite food is Pizza. I love eating Tandoori Chicken Pizza 
            from a pizza shop near my house. Along with the pizza, I also sometimes get
            garlic dipping sauce and chicken wings. 
        </p>

        <p>I sometimes try other toppings on pizza's too. My friend once told me to 
            get a kabob topping which I really liked the first few times but then I got
            used to it and didn't like it anymore
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>Sometimes when we go to my sister's house, we get cheese pizza because
            my nieces can not handle the spiciness of the other toppings. After trying out 
            cheese topping I have got used to it and have started liking it even though 
            its not spicy like the other pizza toppings. 
        </p>

        <p>I am also a hafiz-e-Quran. I memorized the <b>Quran</b> at the age of 17. 
            It took my around 5-6 years. I did it in a <i>madrassa</i> that I used to attend in the evening. I found 
            memorizing to be very hard but <mark>alhamdulillah</mark> I find revision easy and also enjoy it. I lead
            <u>taraweeh</u> every year in the month of Ramadan alhamdulillah.  
        </p>

        <p>This is one of my favorite hadiths from <cite>prophet Muhammad (pbuh)</cite>.</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://thethinkingmuslim.com/2021/06/21/51-short-hadiths-every-muslim-should-know/">
            No fatigue, illness, worry, sorrow, harm, grief, or even the prick of a thorn afflicts a Muslim except that Allah expiates some of his sins by it.
(Bukhari and Muslim)
